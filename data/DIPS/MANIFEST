This folder is where your DIPS dataset will be located once you following the
steps listed under "Creating the DIPS dataset" in this repository's main README.

There are several filters present under filters/ that will be used by default.
They are all based on the version of the PDB downloaded on Nov 20, 2015.
They are listed here:

buried_surface_over_500.txt - Pairs that have over 500 square Angstroms of 
                              buried surface area upon binding.  Basically a 
                              minimum interface size.
nmr_res_less_3.5.txt        - Non-NMR structures with resolution below 3.5
                              Angstroms.
seq_id_less_30.txt          - List of structures which have less than 30% 
                              sequence identity to DB5.
size_over_50.0.txt          - Chains of amino acids that have at least 50 amino 
                              acids.

A list of the folders that will be created is listed here:

raw/
    pdb/               - All structures downloaded from PDB.
interim/
    parsed/            - All pdb pdb structures processed to pickled dataframes.
    complexes/         - List of all possible pairs in parsed.
    pairs/             - Dill files of indivudal pairs listed in complexes.
    pairs-pruned/      - Dill files with filtering criteria applied.
processed/
    tfrecords-pruned/  - pairs-pruned converted to tfrecords.
